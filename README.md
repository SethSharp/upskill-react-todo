# CodingLabs Upskill Challenge: React todo

This app is focused on learning some new skills, the skills learnt here will be:
1. React
2. Native-PHP

## React
I have basically no experience (but some knowledge) of React, considering how popular it is, it will be good to have it 
as a skill.

## Native-PHP
This is a relatively new software, allowing you to run your laravel (php) apps locally as a electron (desktop) app.

# Development
Development setup is just like a regular laravel app, won't go too much into detail. To run the app natively you will
need to do this:
1. `php artisan native:serve` and
2. `npm run dev`
You still need to run the vite server for hot reloading

That is a basic overview, I'm gonna get to coding...
